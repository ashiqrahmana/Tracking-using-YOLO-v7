Certainly! Let's provide a more detailed explanation for both the overall project and the specific YOLOv7 aspect in the GitHub repository.

## Repository Overview

### Tracking using YOLOv7

This repository showcases a project that utilizes YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once version 7) for object tracking, specifically focusing on tracking the position of cars on a highway. YOLOv7 is a real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.

### Contents

#### 1. `images_to_be_uploaded/`

This directory likely contains images relevant to the project, possibly used for training, testing, or demonstrating the tracking capabilities.

#### 2. `zero-shot-object-tracking/`

This directory may be related to the concept of zero-shot learning for object tracking. Zero-shot learning involves training a model to recognize objects that were not present during training, which can be particularly useful for dynamic environments.
